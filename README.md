PolyVerse - a deep learning model using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to predict polymer properties. This helps researchers analyse structure-property relationships, optimize model parameters, and design materials with desired characteristics.

Features
- Polymer tokenizer using SMILES notation
- Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for property prediction
- MERN stack integration for frontend & backend
